## What is Notion?

Notion is a kind of workspace software that helps you manage all of your work in one place. It's an all-in-one platform that combines the power of a task manager, a project management tool, a wiki, and a database into one easy-to-use workspace. Notion is perfect for individuals, and teams.

With Notion, you can easily keep track of your to-do list, plan projects big and small, collaborate with teammates, and store important information all in one place. Notion is flexible and can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from managing a home budget to planning a wedding to building a company wiki.

## Why do I use Notion?

In the following sections, I'll use some screenshots to illustrate my points. I'm hiding some information from them, like the names of colleagues who don't want to be published on this site. I've selected only some non-critical topics as examples, so it might not be the most exciting stuff, but I think it's enough to give you a good idea of what you can do with Notion.

### Organize my day

I always start my day by checking my calendar and adding all the meetings to my logbook. I make sure to include a reference to the meeting notes so I can review the preparation, minutes, and any to-do tasks I may have to monitor or schedule for later.
Then I add any tickets from the day before that I know I will have to work on.
As I complete new tasks throughout the day, I make sure to add them to the log.

It's really helpful for me to keep track of my day-to-day progress by looking at my logbook. I never forget anything because each task has a reference to a Jira ticket.

> Everything is a ticket ¬©

Also all the tasks I have gets a reference to a Todo entry where I track my progresses, blocking points, external documentation I found etc...

Colors indicate the status of the entry.

### Prepare the meetings

Nothing is worse than showing up to a meeting without any preparation. Not doing the basic research you need, or not having a clear idea of what you're going to say. So in order to prepare, my second task of the day after planning is to prepare for today's meetings.

In the following example, I linked the Jira ticket but also my personal notes for the issue we encountered during an Helm update. I noted the solution found and the deployment plan. Plus, I thought of two questions to ask during the meeting.

![Full-width image](/assets/img/blog/Notion/meeting.png){:.lead width="827" height="593" loading="lazy"}

A well prepared meeting means a shorter one üèÅ

### Take the meetings minutes

During a meeting, it can be tough to take notes, but it's definitely worth it. It helps me remember what was said, and every attendee will appreciate getting a copy of the meeting notes. Plus, it helps you keep track of any tasks you agreed to.

I usually just take bullet points, without any fancy formatting (no quotes, no colors, barely any links sometimes). I complete it with a last section called "wrap up" that summarizes the actions I have to take and the people I'm waiting for. I also schedule some reminders if necessary.

![Full-width image](/assets/img/blog/Notion/wrapup.png){:.lead width="954" height="880" loading="lazy"}

It also helps to fill out the tickets after the meetings when tasks have been dispatched.

### Track my work on my tickets

It's probably the most important part of the work I do on Notion.
Note-taking allows me to catch errors early and avoid repeating mistakes.
If something goes wrong, I can quickly see what I did wrong and find a way to fix it.

I also write down my thoughts as I'm working. I'm a visual thinker, so I need to see what I have in mind in order to be efficient.
And finally, if a similar issue occurs, I can quickly find the fix.

Finally, I would add that Notion shows the amount of time a page has been referenced. It allows me to quickly see how long I've been working on this task. And, as I mentioned before, I can easily use it during meetings if needed.

## How to use Notion?

### Start small

It's a bit obvious, but when you're getting started with using any new software, you have to give yourself some time to learn the ropes. Notion isn't the most difficult tool I use, but it can take time to get it set up the way you want it, and you might have to make some bad decisions along the way in order to learn and improve.

The best advice I can give is to start small with a little project. I started with my logbook.

#### Start a logbook

Let's start with a new page to create the logbook itself:

![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/newPage.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
Let's start with a new page
{:.figcaption}
![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/createLogBook.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
Name it and select a `list`
{:.figcaption}
![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/database.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
Then create a new `database`
{:.figcaption}

This is it you have now our LogBook, each entry is a day, and you can simply hit `new page` to add a new one.

With the time, you will have a lot of entries. You can create another secion named `archives` so you can move the old entries in it. No need to order the entries once it's there, and it will still be indexed for researches.
{:.note}

#### Make it a bit pretty

Well that's a good start but it's a bit basic...
We can add a icon and an image to make it prettier to make you enjoy reading what you wrote.

![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/prettier.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
Add an icon and an image
{:.figcaption}
![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/prettier2.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
This is better now
{:.figcaption}

Next begin to feed your first entry for your Log Book, don't forget to change the title, I suggest to use the date instead.
Then... practice, find your own style üòé!

Don't forget to iterate, be agile, try a new thing, test it some days to see if it helps, retry, keep the good and throw the bad ideas.

Here are some tips to be quicker

* `/` stands for the formating and external integration
* `@` stands for the references to
  * other pages
  * dates
{:.note}

### Create and use templates

You will quicly notice that one thing the most annoying is to redo the formatting every days. But don't worry, you don't have to do it. You can create some templates and templates button to make things easier.

When you create a new page you can choose to `create a template`

![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/createTemplate.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Then you can create the page of your dream, don't forget that all the new entries created with it will inherit from it so don't be specific (no dates, no specific tasks...)

One of the most important block to add here is a `template button` in order to automate the way you'll create an entry

![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/templateButton.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/templateButton2.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
Here we create a button that spawn an empty title with a red background (for me means not started)
{:.figcaption}

I would not advice to make too complicated button, you will end up not using it.

> Keep it Simple and Stupid ¬©
{:.lead}

Create all the templates you need to be efficient in your day!

### Look in the past

This is one of the best part in Notion: the search button.
You will have a lot of different pages, all intricated in other pages, and it will be difficult to remember where the information is, but again, no worries, Notion is quite effective with it search bar.

My advise will be that you identify all your tasks with a ticket number, it will be easier to find it for later.

Notion allows you to to apply some filters in your researches, I often use some dates filters in order to fine tune the results.

### Use the API

Notion exposes its API server, the documentation is available [here](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro). Let's give it a try ü¶æ!

We want to be able to automatically ad an entry in our LogBook with the current date as a title
{:.note title="Objective"}

We can use **Python** üêç to do this but the documentation also give you some exemples in many languages.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/DucretJe/notion-add-logbook)
{:.note}

#### Preparation

* Create an [integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
  * Select internal integration, and allow:
    * Read content
    * Modify content
    * Add content
    * No user information
* Save the token

In order to make it work, you also have to share the page with the integration.
![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/shareToIntegration.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
Click on share button
{:.figcaption}

#### Find Database ID

We want to add an entry in a `database`, so we have to identify it first.
This endpoint is documented [here](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-search).

```python
# coding=utf-8

import requests


def get_id(token, name):
    """
    Get ID of a Notion resource authenticating with given token (arg1)
    It uses a query (arg2)
    """
    url = "https://api.notion.com/v1/search"
    payload = {
        "page_size": 4,
        "query": name,
        "filter": {"value": "database", "property": "object"},
    }
    headers = {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer " + token,
    }
    r = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if len(r.json()["results"]) > 1:
        return "Different DB with same name detected"
    return r.json()["results"][0]["id"]
```

#### Add a new entry with the date as title

Now we have our `database_id`, so we can move forward and use the `page` endpoint. It's documented [here](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-page).

```python
# coding=utf-8

from datetime import date

import requests


def compute_title():
    """
    Create title from the date
    Truncated month (3rd first letters)
    """
    today = date.today()
    m = today.strftime("%B")
    d = today.strftime("%d")
    m = m[:3]
    title = m + " " + d
    return title


def new_entry(token, id):
    """
    Add new entry with date as title
    """
    url = "https://api.notion.com/v1/pages"
    payload = {
        "parent": {
            # "type": "database_id",
            "database_id": "e07a5c87-55b0-4d73-b126-65efa40d0bfc",
        },
        "properties": {"Name": {"title": [{"text": {"content": compute_title()}}]}},
    }
    headers = {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer " + token,
    }
    r = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return r.text
```

At this time (2022-07), the API doesn't allow us to use the templates (if someone from Notion read this... üôè)
