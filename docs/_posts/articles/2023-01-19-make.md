## What is Make?

Make.com is a **no code automation tool** that can help you streamline your workflow and organize your information in a more efficient way. One of the ways it can do this is by integrating with Notion, a tool I [already wrote about](https://ducretje.github.io/tools/2022/07/19/notion.html).

The idea of this kind of tool is to ease your daily workflow without having to write anything: *KIRSS* (Keep It Really Simple and Stupid)

## Why do I use Make?

To be honest, automating tasks is quite enjoyable for me. It's satisfying to see things that used to take me time being done by a bot. However, implementing scripts and creating GitHub Actions also comes with its own set of responsibilities, such as maintenance, which can be burdensome. My goal is to free up time, not add more tasks to my plate. This is why I decided to explore no-code automation tools that can handle simple, yet repetitive tasks.


I came across a video on YouTube by French creator [Shubham Sharma](https://youtube.com/@Shubham_Sharma) that addressed this issue.

Specifically, I was interested in streamlining my daily workflow within Notion, as I was in the habit of creating a new page every day with different templates based on my daily status (e.g. focused mode or assisting others while beeing responsible of the outage fast response). Although it may not seem like much, the 5 minutes spent each day on checking my status, updating my calendar, creating my daily page, and checking my emails adds up to 25 minutes per week, which translates to over 1.5 hours I could save per month. ‚è≥

## How did I saved some time

I set up various scenarios in Make that interact with Gmail, Google Calendar, OpsGenie, and Notion. The goal is for these scenarios to automatically trigger at the start of each OpsGenie schedule rotation period on a daily basis.

1. Determine my daily status based on OpsGenie

    ![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/make/opsgenie.jpeg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

    This automation utilizes an API call to OpsGenie to determine who the designated support person is for the day. If I am the support person, another API call is made to Google Calendar to create an event titled "üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Support" for that day.
    If the automation determines that I am not the support person, it will make another API call to OpsGenie to check another schedule called "Shadow" (this schedule is for the person who will assist the support person). Based on the outcome, the automation will create a daily event on Google Calendar titled "üë®‚Äçüíª Focus" or "ü•∑ Shadow" accordingly.

2. Customize my daily page

    ![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/make/notion.jpeg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

    The automation obtains a random quote from [zenquotes.io](https://zenquotes.io) and searches for my daily page that was automatically generated by [repeating template](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/automate-work-repeating-database-templates). The page, named Daily, is then modified by adding the date to the title, updating the icon based on my status obtained from Google Calendar, and including the motivational quote.

3. Get my unread emails

    One thing that was also bothering me was having to constantly check notifications from various sources such as instant messages, emails, PRs and issues. I wanted to have the ability to retrieve my emails in Notion directly into a database that would be filtered on my daily page to show my unread messages.

    ![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/make/retrieve-mails.jpeg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

    Using Make, it's simple to accomplish this task by making an API request on Gmail to retrieve unread emails, then creating an entry in my mail notion database and lastly adding the contents of the email to the database item. Currently, it's not perfect because I often receive HTML code that Notion cannot display. However, I also include a link to the email in the item properties, providing me a quick way to view the email properly.

    Lastly, I wanted to have the ability to mark the emails as read directly from Notion:

    ![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/make/mark-as-read.jpeg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

    This time, the automation monitors the Notion database, focusing on the "last updated" property and specifically the tag I created, which is "üò± Unread" by default. If I change it to "‚úÖ Done", the automation will make an API POST request on Gmail to mark the email as read. I also added a "üí™ Work In Progress" tag to remind me that I am working on it but it's not finished yet.

    I could also do more, for example, generating automated responses using GPT from OpenAI, but I am saving that for later.

## Limitations

It's clear that this tool can help save time and make everyday tasks more efficient by automating low-value tasks. However, it's not without its drawbacks:

* The free plan only allows for 2 concurrent scenarios and 1000 operations, which can be quickly exceeded when creating complex scenarios.
* Editing the scenarios on an iPad can be buggy, as I have experienced while testing it on Safari.
* The Notion module is lacking in features, for example, it's not possible to update the content of a quote, only paragraphs.
