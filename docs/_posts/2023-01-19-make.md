## What is Make?

Make.com is a **no code automation tool** that can help you streamline your workflow and organize your information in a more efficient way. One of the ways it can do this is by integrating with Notion, a tool I [already wrote about](https://ducretje.github.io/tools/2022/07/19/notion.html).

The idea of this kind of tool is to ease your daily workflow without having to write anything: KIRSS (Keep It Really Simple and Stupid)

## Why do I use Make?

To be honest, automating tasks is quite enjoyable for me. It's satisfying to see things that used to take me time being done by a bot. However, implementing scripts and creating GitHub Actions also comes with its own set of responsibilities, such as maintenance, which can be burdensome. My goal is to free up time, not add more tasks to my plate. This is why I decided to explore no-code automation tools that can handle simple, yet repetitive tasks.


I came across a video on YouTube by French creator [Shubham Sharma](https://youtube.com/@Shubham_Sharma) that addressed this issue.

Specifically, I was interested in streamlining my daily workflow within Notion, as I was in the habit of creating a new page every day with different templates based on my daily status (e.g. focused mode or assisting others while beeing responsible of the outage fast response). Although it may not seem like much, the 5 minutes spent each day on checking my status, updating my calendar, creating my daily page, and checking my emails adds up to 25 minutes per week, which translates to over 1.5 hours I could save per month. ‚è≥

## How did I saved some time

I created different scenarios in **Make** in order to interact with Gmail, Google Calendar, OpsGenie and Notion.
The idea is that everyday at the begining of OpsGenie Schedule rotation period those scenarios fire up:

1. Determine my daily status based on OpsGenie

![placeholder](/assets/img/blog/Notion/opsgenie.jpeg){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

This automation makes an API call on OpsGenie and returns the name of the team member who will be the support guy today. If I am the support guy, the automation will make another API call on Google Calendar this time to create a daily event called `üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Support`.
If not it will makes a new API call on OpsGenie on another schedule called *Shadow* (basically the guy who will help the support guy), and depending of the result it will create a daily event `üë®‚Äçüíª Focus` or `ü•∑ Shadow`
