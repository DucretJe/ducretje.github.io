## What is Make?

Make.com is a **no code automation tool** that can help you streamline your workflow and organize your information in a more efficient way. One of the ways it can do this is by integrating with Notion, a tool I [already wrote about](https://ducretje.github.io/tools/2022/07/19/notion.html).

The idea of this kind of tool is to ease your daily workflow without having to write anything: KIRSS (Keep It Really Simple and Stupid)

## Why do I use Make?

To be honest, automating tasks is quite enjoyable for me. It's satisfying to see things that used to take me time being done by a bot. However, implementing scripts and creating GitHub Actions also comes with its own set of responsibilities, such as maintenance, which can be burdensome. My goal is to free up time, not add more tasks to my plate. This is why I decided to explore no-code automation tools that can handle simple, yet repetitive tasks.


I came across a video on YouTube by French creator [Shubham Sharma](https://youtube.com/@Shubham_Sharma) that addressed this issue.

Specifically, I was interested in streamlining my daily workflow within Notion, as I was in the habit of creating a new page every day with different templates based on my daily status (e.g. focused mode or assisting others while beeing responsible of the outage fast response). Although it may not seem like much, the 5 minutes spent each day on checking my status, updating my calendar, creating my daily page, and checking my emails adds up to 25 minutes per week, which translates to over 1.5 hours I could save per month. ‚è≥

## How did I saved some time

I set up various scenarios in Make that interact with Gmail, Google Calendar, OpsGenie, and Notion. The goal is for these scenarios to automatically trigger at the start of each OpsGenie schedule rotation period on a daily basis.

1. Determine my daily status based on OpsGenie

This automation utilizes an API call to OpsGenie to determine who the designated support person is for the day. If I am the support person, another API call is made to Google Calendar to create an event titled "üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Support" for that day.
If the automation determines that I am not the support person, it will make another API call to OpsGenie to check another schedule called "Shadow" (this schedule is for the person who will assist the support person). Based on the outcome, the automation will create a daily event on Google Calendar titled "üë®‚Äçüíª Focus" or "ü•∑ Shadow" accordingly.

2. Customize my daily page

3. Get my unread emails



## Limitations

* Only 2 concurrent scenarios in the free plan and 1000 operations (quickly reached especially when you are creating complex scenarios)
*
