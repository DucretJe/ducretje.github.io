Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome on my website. 

> _Who am I?_
{:.lead}

I guess you're here because you want to know me better, perhaps to prepare an interview or because you wonder what the company I am working for does.
Well I'll try to answer some of your questions.

> _What do I do?_
{:.lead}

I am **JÃ©rÃ´me Ducret** and I am an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer), currently employed by [Evooq SA](https://www.evooq.ch/) in Lausanne (Switzerland).

If you wonder what an SRE does, well the short answer would be helping developers to deploy, monitor and update their applications. You can see this as building some pipelines in a factory to make sure what you create is done fast, smoothly and without any bottleneck.  

In order to achieve it, we try to automate everything we can (ie: The monitoring system sees that there isn't a lot of free memory on the system, it sends a notification to the developer and adds more memory to the system). In a way a very talented SRE will put him(her)self out of business! 

>_Why do I have an unusual carreer path?_
{:.lead}

You may come here because of my resume and you wonder if I made some messy copy/paste seeing my past experiences / education. Well, short answer is no ðŸ™ƒ. 

I studied **law** first in [UniversitÃ© de Savoie](https://www.univ-smb.fr/en/) in ChambÃ©ry (France), then in [UniversitÃ© Jean Moulin](https://www.univ-lyon3.fr/accueil-en). The original plan was to become a lawyer or a _mandataire judiciaire_ (legal officer involved in settlement of bankruptcies), but to be honnest the amount of additional studies was too high and I discovered the world of finance during my summer jobs.

This lead me to work as a financial Counsellor for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) for [CrÃ©dit Industriel et Commercial](https://www.cic.fr/) (CIC) in Villeurbanne (France). This position allowed me to meet very interesting people from various horizon. I also learned a lot about finance and business in France. I realised I prefered the financial analysis over the sales, so I evolved to a Credit Analyst position where I could consolidate my skills.

Still I felt that I had to move to another branch: IT. I tried a bit on development but I was quickly fascinated by network and OS topics so I focused on Infrastructure studies. Beeing a banker, I choosed to manage my risks and choose to continue my work even if I was going back to school. Difficult gamble but luckily I found [Openclassroom](https://openclassrooms.com) and I've been able to prepare my diploma without stopping to work. It took me 2 years to finish it but I was happy to learn every evening.

Once my diploma acquired, I started to look for a DevOps job in Switzerland (Since I was changing my life, why not moving in this beautiful country?). I found a really good opportunity at Evooq, and here am I: Still learning but so proud of my 3 experiences ðŸ™‚.

>_Why this website?_
{:.lead}

First, to answer some questions you may have after reading my resume. Secondly I wanted to write some blog articles about tools I use, techs I find interesting etc... I hope you'll find it interesting ðŸ¤ž.

>_You are an SRE why don't you host this website yourself?_
{:.lead}

Well, yes I could but it would imply to maintain it (meaning update the OS, the softwares, secure it), and also pay for the hosting. In the other hand GitHub allows me to host this website for free, and they do all the work for me (thanks for your work guys ðŸ¥°).

But I also believe in the **KISS** principle [(Keep It Simple and Stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), I want this website to be reliable, simple to update and cost effective. GitHub is a pretty good match!
